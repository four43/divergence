Divergence Router
=================

A fast router for PHP, as easy, or as full featured as you need it.

Insipred by ToroRouter (https://github.com/anandkunal/ToroPHP), which is a great
router to quickly create simple apps, Divergence aims to be almost as simple, but
provide more features for larger apps.

Features
--------

* Simple single file router - commented and easy to understand.
* Built in debug handler - add it to your app temporarily to see what callbacks
get called when, and with what data.
